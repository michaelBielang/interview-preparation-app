# Introduction

This repository is part of my upcoming youtube series on how to build a microservice architecture with a simple backend and frontend.

This demo should give the user an idea how to properly structure and setup your project. I also demonstrate in my video sessions some common mistakes as well how to avoid them.

In the end you will have built an app which you can also use for training purposes to deal with interview questions which often does not make sense in daily business but are still practised a lot for reasons.

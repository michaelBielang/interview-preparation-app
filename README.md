# Introduction

This repository is part of my upcoming youtube series on how to build a microservice architecture with a simple backend and frontend.

This demo can give you an idea how to properly structure and setup a project. In my video sessions I also demonstrate some common mistakes as well how to avoid them.

In the end you will have an app which you can use with a provided collection of questions and answers.

These you can use and extend to prepare for interviews. 

These are commonly asked questions, which make sometimes more or less sense in the dailys business ;)
